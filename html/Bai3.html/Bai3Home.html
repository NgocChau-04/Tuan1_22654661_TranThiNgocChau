    <p><br><span id="c1">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</br>

        <br>I've started putting up a slide show of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</br>

           Once again: <span id="c1">BRAVO!!!</span> -- Mrs. Juroszek
